deload unneccessary structure when it isn't needed
    maybe make parent refs strong, remove top level keep requirement, and add a strong reference to nodes with strokes
        makes deletion from top down harder
    maybe make enum for child ref that can switch to using weak ref that is used for temporary structures
export/import
disable rendering for high depth
render approximation color for high depth objects that don't get rendered
render parent objects up to level where rendering to lower still doesn't work
render to lower layer background to prevent not rendering large objects
fix ensure loaded arbitrarily high cost
    possibly impossible for panning case due to create neighbor having O(n) cost when creating initial structure
    might be possible if you don't create neccessary structure when doing create neighbor but do if you zoom in / out on area without structure
        don't know of a way to do this without storing the position of these structureless neighbors
            the position storage would have O(n) creation cost anyways
